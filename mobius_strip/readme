# Möbius Strip 3D Model

## 📌 Features
- 3D mesh modeling of the Möbius strip using parametric equations.
- Numerical computation of:
  - Surface Area
  - Edge Length
- 3D visualization using Matplotlib.

## 🧠 Parametric Equations Used
x(u, v) = (R + v cos(u/2)) cos(u)  
y(u, v) = (R + v cos(u/2)) sin(u)  
z(u, v) = v sin(u/2)  
with u in [0, 2π], v in [-w/2, w/2]

## 📊 Surface Area Approximation
Using vector calculus:
- Compute partial derivatives w.r.t `u` and `v`
- Calculate the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors
- Integrate over the parametric domain using Simpson's Rule.

## 🔁 Edge Length
- Construct boundary using v = ±w/2 at various `u` values.
- Sum Euclidean distances between consecutive edge points.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
- Ensuring numerical stability and smooth mesh with finite resolution.
- Correct handling of parameter derivatives for accurate area estimation.
