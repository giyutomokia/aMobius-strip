 Task
Write a Python script that models a Mobius strip using parametric equations and computes key geometric properties.

1. Requirements
Define a MobiusStrip class that:

Accepts:

Radius R (distance from the center to the strip)
Width w (strip width)
Resolution n (number of points in the mesh)
Computes:

A 3D mesh/grid of (x, y, z) points on the surface
Surface area (numerically, using integration or approximation)
Edge length (numerically along the boundary)
2. Parametric Equation of Mobius Strip
Use the parametric equations:

x
(
u
,
v
)
=
(
R
+
v
⋅
cos

(
u

)
)

y
(

,
v
)
=

)
⋅
sin
⁡
(
u
)

z
(
u
,
v
)
=
v
⋅
sin
⁡
(

)

Where:

u
∈
[

v
∈
[
